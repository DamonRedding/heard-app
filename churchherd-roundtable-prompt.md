# ChurchHeard.com Expert Roundtable Analysis Prompt

## Mission
Conduct a comprehensive multi-expert roundtable analysis of ChurchHeard.com to identify foundational mechanics issues, growth opportunities, user engagement problems, and value proposition effectiveness through live application testing and research-backed principles.

## Core Principle: RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION
Every recommendation must be ruthlessly prioritized. We will:
- **Kill** recommendations that don't directly address P0 foundational issues
- **Defer** good ideas that distract from critical path
- **Focus** only on the vital few that will move the needle
- **Challenge** every assumption about what "must" be done
- Apply the **80/20 rule** relentlessly - what 20% of fixes will solve 80% of problems?

## Phase 1: Live Application Diagnosis (Playwright MCP)

**Objective**: Use Playwright MCP to interact with and diagnose the live ChurchHeard.com application

### Investigation Tasks:
1. **Navigate and Document** the complete user journey from landing page through core features
2. **Analyze the Live Feed** - Capture screenshots and interaction patterns
3. **Test Core Interactions** - Post creation, engagement mechanisms, navigation flows
4. **Identify UX Friction Points** - Loading times, unclear CTAs, interaction barriers
5. **Document Visual Hierarchy** - Information architecture and visual design assessment

### Key Questions to Answer:
- **Engagement Mystery**: Why is there little to no engagement with posts?
  - Test: Can users easily find, interact with, and respond to content?
  - Test: Are engagement mechanisms visible and intuitive?
  - Test: What friction exists in the engagement flow?

- **Value Proposition Clarity**: How is the value prop being communicated and used?
  - Test: Is the core value immediately clear on landing?
  - Test: Does the user journey reinforce the value proposition?
  - Test: Are features aligned with stated benefits?

**Deliverable**: Technical diagnosis document with screenshots, interaction flows, and identified issues

### Structured Output Format

#### Executive Summary
- Current state assessment (1 paragraph)
- Critical findings (3-5 bullets)
- Strategic recommendation (1 paragraph)

---

#### Critical Issues by Priority

**RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:**

For each issue, answer:
1. **If we only fix ONE thing, is it this?** (Yes/No - be brutal)
2. **Impact Score** (1-10): How much does this move the needle?
3. **Effort Score** (1-10): How hard is this to fix?
4. **Impact/Effort Ratio**: Prioritize highest ratios only
5. **Kill It?**: Should we delete/defer this entirely?

**THE VITAL FEW (Maximum 3 Issues)**

Only include if Impact/Effort ratio > 5 and team consensus that it's top 3:

**Issue #1: [The ONE Thing]**
- **Issue**: Clear description
- **Why It's #1**: Blocking everything else / highest impact-to-effort
- **Evidence**: Playwright findings + expert consensus
- **Solution**: Specific, actionable recommendation (simplest possible)
- **Owner**: Single owner (no committees)
- **Success Metric**: ONE metric that matters most
- **Timeline**: Days/weeks (not months)

**Issue #2 & #3**: [Only if truly vital]
[Same ruthless structure]

---

**DEFERRED (Good Ideas, Wrong Time)**
List of recommendations that are valuable but NOT in top 3
- Why deferred
- When to revisit (after what milestone)

---

**KILLED (Stop Doing / Delete)**
Features, processes, or ideas to eliminate entirely
- Why killed
- What we gain by removing it

---

#### Principle-Backed Recommendations

For each major recommendation:
- **Recommendation**: Specific action to take
- **Principle**: Research-backed principle supporting it (cite source)
- **Expert Consensus**: Which experts agree and why
- **Implementation Approach**: How to execute
- **Expected Outcome**: Measurable improvement expected
- **Validation Method**: How to test effectiveness

---

#### Prioritized Roadmap (RUTHLESSLY SIMPLIFIED)

**Week 1: The ONE Thing**
- Fix the single biggest blocker identified
- Nothing else matters this week
- Success metric: Can we measure improvement?

**Weeks 2-3: The Vital Two**
- Fix issues #2 and #3 ONLY
- Resist scope creep
- Kill any new requests

**Week 4: Validate & Iterate**
- Measure impact of the vital few
- Kill what didn't work
- Double down on what did
- Decide: continue or pivot?

**NO PHASE 2 UNTIL:**
- The vital few are fixed AND validated
- Metrics show measurable improvement
- Team explicitly decides to move forward

## Notes

- **RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION IS THE META-SKILL** - Most recommendations should be killed or deferred
- Foundation first - absolutely NO growth tactics if foundation is broken
- Challenge assumptions throughout - use Socratic mode liberally
- **Force rank everything** - no ties allowed, brutal honesty required
- **Simple > Comprehensive** - One perfect fix beats ten mediocre ones
- **Kill darlings** - Delete features, defer "nice-to-haves," focus maniacally
- Ask "If we only fix ONE thing..." repeatedly until consensus emerges
- Measure everything - ONE metric per recommendation maximum
- **Speed matters** - Can this be done in a week? If not, simplify further

## Prioritization Mantras

1. **"If we could only fix ONE thing, what would it be?"** (Force singular focus)
2. **"What should we STOP doing?"** (Subtraction > addition)
3. **"Is this a nice-to-have or a must-have?"** (Kill nice-to-haves)
4. **"Can we measure this in days/weeks?"** (Timeboxing forces clarity)
5. **"What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?"** (Occam's Razor)
