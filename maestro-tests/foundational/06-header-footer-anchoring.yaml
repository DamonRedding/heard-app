name: Header & Footer Anchoring Test
---
# Foundational UX Test: Headers and footers must remain anchored during scrolling
# Validates that fixed position elements don't move with content

- launchApp

# Test 1: Initial state - capture header/footer positions
- assertVisible:
    text: "Feed"

- takeScreenshot: "01-initial-positions"

# Test 2: Scroll down - header/footer should stay in same position
- scroll

- waitForAnimationToEnd

- assertVisible:
    text: "Feed"  # Navigation still visible
- assertVisible:
    text: "Churches"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Search"
- assertVisible:
    text: "Settings"

- takeScreenshot: "02-after-scroll-down"

# Test 3: Multiple scrolls - positions should remain fixed
- repeat:
    times: 5
    commands:
      - scroll
      - waitForAnimationToEnd

- assertVisible:
    text: "Feed"

- takeScreenshot: "03-after-multiple-scrolls"

# Test 4: Scroll to top - verify no position shift
- swipe:
    start: "50%, 30%"
    end: "50%, 80%"
    duration: 1000

- waitForAnimationToEnd

- assertVisible:
    text: "Feed"

- takeScreenshot: "04-after-scroll-top"

# Test 5: Navigate to different page - check anchoring persists
- tapOn:
    text: "Churches"

- waitForAnimationToEnd

- scroll

- assertVisible:
    text: "Churches"  # Navigation still anchored

- takeScreenshot: "05-churches-scrolled"

# Test 6: FAB should also remain anchored during scroll
- tapOn:
    text: "Feed"

- waitForAnimationToEnd

- assertVisible:
    text: "Share Your Experience"  # FAB

- scroll

- assertVisible:
    text: "Share Your Experience"  # FAB still visible

- takeScreenshot: "06-fab-anchored"

# Test 7: Test content scrolls behind fixed elements
# This validates that content moves while headers/footers don't
- swipe:
    start: "50%, 50%"
    end: "50%, 20%"
    duration: 500
