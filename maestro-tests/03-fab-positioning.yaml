name: FAB Positioning & Collision Test (P0 - Critical)
---
# Test: FAB must have minimum 32px gap from navigation
# Current: FAB bottom: 5rem (80px), Nav height: 4rem (64px)
# Gap: 80px - 64px = 16px (TOO SMALL)
# Required: ≥32px gap
#
# Location: client/src/components/share-fab.tsx:56
# User Impact: Accidental taps, poor hand ergonomics

    text: "Feed"

# Verify FAB is visible

# Test: Try tapping in the gap between FAB and navigation
# This should NOT trigger either element accidentally
- tapOn:
    point: "50%,85%"  # Between FAB and nav

- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Should still be on Feed (not navigated away)

# Navigate to Churches to test context-aware FAB

# Test scroll behavior with FAB
- scroll
# FAB should remain visible and properly positioned
