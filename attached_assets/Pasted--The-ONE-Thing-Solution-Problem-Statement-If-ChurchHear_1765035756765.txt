## The ONE Thing Solution

### Problem Statement

**If ChurchHeard could only fix ONE thing, what should it be?**

**Answer:** Build a post-submission engagement loop that converts one-time submitters into active community members.

### Why This is THE ONE Thing

**Impact Score:** 10/10
- Directly addresses root cause (retention failure)
- Activates existing 32 submitters (proven interested users)
- Creates engagement needed for social proof
- Unlocks all other improvements (can't curate feed without engagement to show)

**Effort Score:** 4/10
- Post-submission flow (3 screens)
- Email system (3 templates)
- Matching algorithm (category + denomination)
- ~50 hours total development

**Impact/Effort Ratio:** 2.5 (Highest priority)

**Dependency Analysis:**
- ✅ Can be built immediately (no prerequisites)
- ✅ Unblocks everything else (feed curation, social proof, community growth)
- ✅ Addresses root cause (not symptoms)

### The Solution Architecture

**3-Part System:**

```
Part 1: Post-Submission Flow (Immediate)
    ↓
Part 2: Email Triggers (24-48 hours + ongoing)
    ↓
Part 3: Weekly Retention (Long-term)
```

### Part 1: Post-Submission Engagement Flow

**Trigger Moment:** Immediately after user clicks "Submit" on their story

**Behavioral Psychology:**
- ✅ Reciprocity principle (you shared, now support others)
- ✅ Peak emotional moment (user just shared trauma, in giving mindset)
- ✅ Related content (same category, denomination)
- ✅ Low friction (large "I Hear You" buttons visible)
- ✅ Social proof per post (existing engagement shown)

**Matching Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for related post matching
function getRelatedPosts(submittedPost) {
  return posts
    .filter(p => p.category === submittedPost.category)
    .filter(p => p.denomination === submittedPost.denomination || !submittedPost.denomination)
    .filter(p => p.createdAt > Date.now() - 7days) // Recent only
    .sort((a, b) => b.engagementCount - a.engagementCount) // Most engaged first
    .slice(0, 5); // Show max 5
}
```

**Behavioral Psychology:**
- ✅ Optional (not forced)
- ✅ Clear value proposition (know when supported)
- ✅ Variable reward setup (unpredictable timing = dopamine)
- ✅ Commitment device (opting in increases return likelihood)

**Expected Conversion:**
- 70% view recommended posts
- 40% engage with at least 1 post during this flow
- 50% opt into email notifications
