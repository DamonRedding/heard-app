I was actually my pastor’s go to person for everything.   I had been in the ministry for over 20 years. \n\nOur ministry was all black until a few weeks ago when a white lady and her son joined the ministry.  Her 48 year old son wanted to teach dance to the youth. I had concerns because he was new to the ministry, no one knew him and no one had ever seen him dance.  At the time my daughter was the youth leader and dance teacher. She has a degree in dance and was concerned because the new man wanted to teach the kids alone (without her and without the parents) and showed no knowledge of dance terminology. Of course that raised flags to us.\n\nHowever my pastor and his wife were allowing him to do so.   I questioned it after I noticed that he was visiting with his kids at the church after service because he was going through a divorce and the court was not allowing him to visit with his kids without \nSupervision. I told them if the courts won’t allow him to visit with his kids alone why would we allow it?\n\nI was responsible for doing background checks on anyone who wants to work in the ministry. His background check revealed that he had dissociative identity disorder and he needed serious psychiatric help. I brought this before the board and they dismissed my concerns as if it was a jealousy thing because of my daughter.  I only asked them not to allow him to work with the kids until he had his situation taken care of with his kids. I was not judging him. I asked them  just to let him sit for a while before he is allowed to work with our children. No one agreed.  \n\nI thought as pastors we are to protect our flock especially our innocent children.  This guy has serious issues but no one seemed concerned but my daughter and I.  We had a meeting, the board disagreed. They said that “no one was perfect and we can’t just throw people away.”  Of course we left the ministry.   \n\n\n\n\n","category":"leadership","denomination":"Non-denominational","timeframe":"last_month","condemnCount":0,"absolveCount":8,"meTooCount":5,"flagCount":0,"viewCount":0,"commentCount":3,"status":"active","churchName":null,"pastorName":null,"location":null,"createdAt":"2025-12-04T06:55:05.257Z"},{"id":"e73eb897-9f44-4de4-88af-5d4deb1cbe77","title":null,"content":"WHAT SHOULD I DO? \n\nI told my Pastor that I am accepting my call to the Ministry.

My family joined a black \"Baptist\" church that year as well; they didn't have a pastor. We selected a pastor who had a wife but no children together. They were really great at first. When the pastor found out that I was ordained, he asked me to \"preach\" on a 5th Sunday. After that, I became an Associate Minister. The pastor's wife and I became best of friends until I became the President of the Choir, which she spearheaded. Jealousy ended up controlling this lady. She spread most of the personal things that were shared with her as MY supposed best friend. We were looking for a minister of music at that time, but he became so enamored with me, and I'm a married woman, so she got more jealous. She had the paster set up a meeting with my husband and me, and the [sinister] of music all to verbally attack me. I had done nothing wrong but work very hard in building the church body, which went from 20 to about 100. So I feel they got the big head and wanted my family out of the way. \n\nThis lady told me that I could go kill myself, and the church hated me.  The Pastor didn't stop the attack because he became jealous too and joined in. And my husband just sat there and said nothing and did nothing. But I'm from the hood, so I can hold my own. I never disrespected them, even though they were disrespectful to me. The words of attack on my personal life, not my church life. So I was not only hurt from that, but mostly hurt from my husband not even protecting me when I was being attacked IN THE CHURCH. I was never apologized to. She stood up in front of the congregation and apologized to my husband for disrespecting me, but I never got a formal apology. \n\nUnfortunately, she has now been diagnosed with stage 2 cancer and wants our friendship back. All I can do is pray for them. So I tried it again at the church my mom-in-law is a pastor of, and the same thing happened because of jealousy.

Growing up and looking back I realize that the senior pastors never had a job and yet had the biggest house and most expensive cars.. then the housing crisis hit in 2008 and everyone lost their houses. But what was the message leadership gave us? “De la ofrenda Que te duela” (give the offering that hurts) so that you can see the hand of God moving in your finances. Oh it hurt alright. I watched leaders in our church lose their homes scrambling to find a place to stay (now imagine the financial neglect and otherwise their matrimonies and children felt). And yet.. the senior pastors never lost their homes.. what’s more, no matter the season anyone was going through, if they found out you missed a tithe they wrote you a letter personally calling you unfaithful, quoting scripture and so on. My father got a letter. Never for help, only when his tithe fell short. one of the drummers got a letter as soon as he won a $30,000 lawsuit. “Give unto Caesar that which belongs to..” you get the idea. Even the senior pastors son, when he needed help, suddenly theirs a fund for some of the repairs on his home, but what about the rest of us? I went 4 years in high school and my braces broke in my mouth and my parents couldn’t afford to fix it, but never missed a tithe so that they could always be “blessed”.. they tithed so much the IRS audited them saying it was impossible, when my father showed them proof they took it back.

To be honest I ve began writing you many times but have stopped myself from doing so.  I am a pastors kid and for many years I’ve worked closely with many pastors helping them  I’m any way I could because being a pastors kid I know of their  struggles.  For the past 7 year i have been a part of a small church.  I love it however shortly after starting going to this church I was asked to be a part of the board which I gladly agreed.  A red flag which I regret overlooking was that the pastors asked me to be a part of the board because they were having trouble with the treasurer who them was giving them a hard time when they ask for money.  A side note prior to starting in this church I had known both the pastors and the treasurer because we were all members in a previous church.  The problem began when I began helping treasurer and noticed how the pastors would used the church funds as thou it was theirs.  Mind you this was a small congregation of only 13 members of which the pastors never made any attempts to help the church grow.  Apparently the pastors problem was not that the treasurer was not allowing them to use the funds but that he was questioning them why the money was used and asking for receipts something they did not want to do.  To make matters worse the pastors have been doing this for years when I questioned the other 2 board members about the pastors expense they simple said they did not know what to do so unfortunately I became the whistleblower and contacted the leaders of our denomination.  To make a long story short the pastors were basically asked to leave.  They retaliated by throwing the board under the bus.  We were hated by just about every pastor, church member, family friend etc. in our area but there is no way I could stand by and see how the pastors would used the church funds as their own while their were members in our congregation that needed it and it wasn’t like we never bought the pastors what they needed.
